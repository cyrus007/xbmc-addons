Currently this repository has the following XBMC Addons:
1) IndoLyrics - a lyrics addon script to show hindi lyrics from Giitayan.com, you need a unicode ttf font which is capable of showing hindi characters and the Genre tags of songs should be tagged as hindi.
2) Numi Khoj - search for hindi movies at sites like rangu.com and bharatmovies.com (Note that it uses my modified version of t0mm0's script.module.urlresolver)
3) urlresolver - modified version of Eldorado's version of script.module.urlresolver to go in my repository to avoid broken dependencies

Download the repository metadata zip file from either work branch (which might have unstable code) or master branch and install the repository in XBMC. After that you will get the option to install the individual addons.
